Multi-cored hard-wired devices are ruling the current computational devices, and
all main stream languages and technology utilizes this feature to produce more advanced
featured applications and practical implementations. These approaches thereby bringing
potential benefit of parallelism. But only in the web where JavaScript has been heavily
used for handling UI events and data, this feature was untapped till recent days, because
of the single threaded nature of Javascript. But as part of the HTML5 specification W3C
introduced an API for running scripts in the background independently of any user
interface scripts called web workers which offer a way to exploit parallelism in
JavaScript.

This paper explores the implementation of web workers to solve parallel execution issue
in an observable pattern for better utilization of resources by converging benefits of both
the parallel and distributed computing paradigms. Here, we are proposing an architectural
approach where web-workers are implemented as independent observables for cloud
based application. This includes the components and paradigm for achieving parallel
execution of tasks by utilizing observable patterns for distributed execution in cloud
resource as well as offline on the client side.

Observable Worker API
=====================

Initialize an observable worker
-------------------------------
An observable worker can be initialized as follows

    var obWorker = new ObservableWorker(workerjs, options);

**workerjs** can be worker file or a js function reference. But with following conditions

1. the workerjs should be a webworker compatible file

        var worker = new Webworker(workerjsfile);
        worker.postMessage(data);
        worker.onmessage(function(processedData) { });

2. or it can be a normal function reference which doesn't have any external dependency like global varaiable, external modules, plugins, dom access etc. The function shoud return the expected result.

        var processedData = workerjs(data);


**Options**

    {
        server : {
            url:'http://localhost:8888/workers',
            auth : 'session'| 'none' | 'token',
            silentfail : true

        },
        maxWorkers: // the number of maximun worker in client and server
    }

silentfail will determine , on server connection lost be silent or throw error and restart with out server


Assigning data
------------------

    obWorker.data(data, options);


1.  **data**  - data to processing which can pass to workerfile to get processed and return the result on on-message.
data can be an array or string compatible with worker function.

2. **options**

        {
         id: 1 ,
         processTime: false,//default
         workerid : false,//default
         async : false
        }
    1.  **id** -  a unique identifier that will return with result on complete , can be an array if data is an array , if not mentioned then array index will be returned.
   2.    **processTime** - a boolean to mention whether to get back the processed time.
   3.    **workerId** - a boolean to mention whether to get back the worker id.
   4.    **async** -  a boolean to mention whether to call the on-complete on each data if data is an array or on complete of all the data.


Subscribe to  processed data
------------------------

After the function call is completed  *subscribe* function will be called with  callback


     obWorker.subscribe(function(result, details, err){

     });

**Eg: **

    var obWorker = new ObservableWorker(getSquare).data([10,20,30,40]);

    obWorker.subscribe(function(result, resultdetails, err){
        console.log(result,resultdetails);
        //[100,400,900,1600]
    });
**Eg: with "async : true"**

    function getSquare(x){
     return x*x;
    }

    var obWorker = new ObservarWorker(getSquare).data([10,20,30,40],{ async: true });

    obWorker.subscribe(function(result, resultdetails, err){
        console.log(result,resultdetails);
    });
    // 100,0
    // 400,1
    // 1600,3
    // 900,2
the *subscribe* will get triggered when ever a function call on any of the data is completed with *async:true*

Getting observable map
----------------------

If *subscribe* is true an observable map of data will be available to **obWorker** object. and some data is on process the result will be ""



    var observableMap = obWorker.getMap();
    log(observableMap);
    //{data:[10,20,30,40], result:[100,400,900,1600]};

If you want to change the data at particular index use *'setIndexData'* , this will also trigger subscription.

    obWorker.setIndexData(7,2);


**Other API methods**

To check whether all data in array is processed or not

    obWorker.inProcess();

 To check whether worker is connected to server

    obWorker.isConnected();

On server error/connection lost etc

    obWorker.onServerError(function(err){ });

Return an object with worker id list

    obWorker.getWorkerDetails();
       // {
            client : [1234,1235,1236],
            server : []
          }
